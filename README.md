# Welcome to the Steam Coffeee Co Repo!

## What is Steam Coffee Co?

### Steam Coffee Co is a website for a coffee business.  The website allows a user to filter beverages by typing in the name of the drink or by price point.
### After a user selects their order, an order summary is populated in the shopping cart on the next page.



## Technologies Used:

### Angular, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Materialize
### For this assignment I learned about Angular.  This is only my second application built using Angular.  
### To understand Angular, I became familar with directives, services, and controllers.    
### I learned that using $rootscope should be avoided.  (The first application I build using Angular, Galvanize showed use $rootscope to pass data.)
### I also became familary with Materialize to style my site.
